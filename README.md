# An-LLM-driven-Approach-to-Gain-Cybercrime-Insights-with-Evidence-Networks

## About
This is the tool we created in the research of "Forensic Intelligence Graphs: An LLM Approach to Digital Evidence Extraction and Relationship Analysis." This tool utilizes LLMs to extract evidence entities from mobile devices and infers relationships among them. Using this information, the tool enables the generation of Forensic Intelligence Graphs (FIGs).


We published the code, preprocessed data, and experimental results here for reproduction.
